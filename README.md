# 👋 Yo, I’m Abuild Simukoko — aka *The Techman*

🎯 **Cybersecurity Expert | Full-Stack Developer | Entrepreneur | Digital Strategist**

I’m not your average developer. I’m the kind that breaks systems — then builds better ones.  
Born and raised in Kitwe, Zambia, I’ve been on a mission to fuse cybersecurity, code, and business strategy to build tech that actually solves real problems.
